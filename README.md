# ScrapNinja
Python project called ScrapeNinja that implements a web scraping service with an attractive GUI. This project lets a user enter a URL, choose a scraping mode (static using requests/BeautifulSoup or dynamic using Selenium), view the scraped results (page title and links), and save the output in either JSON or CSV format.
